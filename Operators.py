# Write a Python program that takes two numbers from the user and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Display the results for each operation.
#  Write a Python program to calculate the remainder and the quotient of two numbers. Quotient Should be an Integer
# Given a number, write a program that calculates its square and cube.
# Start with a variable x = 10. Use assignment operators to increment x by 5, multiply it by 3, and subtract 4. Print the final value of x.
