#  Write a Python program that assigns your name and age to two different variables. Then, reassign the age variable with a new value.
#  Assign the value of x = 10. Reassign it to x + 5 and print the result.
# Take a number from the user as input. The input is a string by default. Convert it into an integer and print the result.

# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter their age, and then cast the input to an integer. After that, assign their age in the next decade (age + 10) to a new variable and print it.

a= "Ram"
b= 33
b= 32
print (b)

x=10
y=x+5
print (y)

userInput = input("please enter the age :")
userInputNum=int(userInput)
print (userInputNum)


floatVar=20.5
intVar=int(floatVar)
print(floatVar)
print(intVar)

age=input("plese enter the age:")
ageInt=int(age)
print(ageInt)
newAge=ageInt+10
print(newAge)
