# Please Answer the Below Questions and Give Your Explanation in One Line After Completing the Assignment
 # Write a Python program that assigns your name and age to two different variables. Then, reassign the age variable with a new value.
 # Assign e and age to variablesthe value of x = 10. Reassign it to x + 5 and print the result.
# Take a number from the user as input. The input is a string by default. Convert it into an integer and print the result.
# Assign a float value to a variable, then cast it to an integer. Print both the float and the integer values.
# Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter their age, and then cast the input to an integer. After that, assign their age in the next decade (age + 10) to a new variable and print it.


name = "lokesh"
age = 20
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
age = 22
print("Updated Age:", age)

#

x = 5
e = 4
age = x
print("Initial e:", e)
print("Initial age:", age)
x = x + 7
print("Updated x:", x)

#

input 
user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
number = int(user_input)
print("The converted integer is:", number)

#

float_value = 13.75
int_value = int(float_value)
print("Float value:", float_value)
print("Integer value:", int_value)

#

user_input = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(user_input)
age_next_decade = age + 2
print("Your age in the next decade will be:", age_next_decade)
